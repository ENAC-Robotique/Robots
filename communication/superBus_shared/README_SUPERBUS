Superbus is a network API working over several bus interfaces.



Requirements :
    - Every project in which is used the superbus API (lib_superbus.h) MUST have a params.h file, described below.
    - Every project in which is used the superbus API (lib_superbus.h) MUST include the "drivers" for the interfaces, matching the prototypes of the ones in superBus_arduino for example)
    
    
params.h description : 
In addition to your personal project parameters, the params.h file MUST contain the following :
    #define MYADDRX (device's Xbee address)         //if MYADDRX==0, Xbee interface will not be used (do so if the device is not equipped with XBee) 
    #define MYADDRI (device's I2C address)          //if MYADDRI==0, I2C interface will not be used (do so if the device is not equipped with I2C)
    #define SB_INC_MSG_BUF_SIZE (device's incoming message buffer size)
    #define ARCH_(device's architecture)
