    - Every project in which is used the superbus API (lib_superbus.h) MUST include a network_cfg.h and network_cfg.c files, like the .examples files
    - Every project in which is used the superbus API (lib_superbus.h) MUST include the "drivers" for the interfaces, matching the prototypes of the ones in superBus_arduino for example)
