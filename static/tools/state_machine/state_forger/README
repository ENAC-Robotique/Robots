You can create your own models.
the followings keywords will be replace by correspondant datas:
%STATENAME%
%DATE%
%AUTHOR%
%INCLUDES%        #do not write other thing in the same line, it will be crush.
%FLAGS%           #do not write other thing in the same line, it will be crush.

The name of the file will be the name of the model + the state name.

 if there is a file named "myfile_.ext" in your model directory and your state name is "Mystate",
 the file name will be "myfile_Mystate.ext"
